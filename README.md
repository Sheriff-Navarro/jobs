## Who are we?

LaunchScience is a well-funded startup building marketing Saas for product people: https://launchscience.com.

**We're building the Go-to-Market platform.** Our customers ship product fast and often. But too often their marketing processes are in left in the dark ages, leading to miscommunication and missed opportunities. LaunchScience is the missing tool for product owners with deadlines.

We're 3 founders and 3 engineers, looking for our 7th person. Our early team comes from Twitter, Google, Accenture, scaling startups and successful exits. The CEO of LaunchScience sold his previous company to a large telecommunications company for >$100 million.

Our mostly-remote team has been collaborating together for 1 year. We've introduced our product to an open-Beta with a select group of customers and a list of hundreds on our waitlist. We expect to launch to the public in the coming months.

## Why work with us?

### This is a software team where you can do the best work in your career.

We believe that a great product is only possible with great engineering. And we've found that a high quality web UX moves the needle for our target customer. So we're investing in ways for engineers to do great work here:

- *Continuous delivery:* every pull-request merge goes to production. We ship dozens of times per day.
- *PR dev environments:* any engineer can spin up an unlimited number of full-stack instances of our application, open to the internet, using git.
- *Automated infrastructure:* all of our infrastructure is managed with an infra-as-code system. Changes are safe and easy.

### We're in a big market with a lot of upside

- Every product team in the world faces the problems that LaunchScience is solving!
