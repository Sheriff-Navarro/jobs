[Resume Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rG2krXCDCUKPfaNzUfh_4VOB45vjsSXE/view?usp=sharing)

## Why work with me?

I'm a highly motivated employee (self-starter). I have helped engineer React Applications in the eCommerce (retail), Banking, and HealthCare industries over my career. My experience ranges from wearing many hats in fast-growing startups to building highly scalable applications in companies such as American Express. These applications ranged from internal to customer facing with millions of impressions. In addition, in my most recent role at vitaCare (subsidiary of GoodRx), I was tasked with architecting, implementing, and documenting all UI Applications. In the two+ years in this role three applications were created utilizing React, Typescript, Jest, RTL, GraphQL, Next.JS, and Redux. Lastly, I took great pride in all the UI applications maintaining a 100% Unit Test Coverage this ensured high confidence when shipping our code to production environments. I am highly proficient in Javascript UI Applications though I would like to extend my knowledge to the backend. Lastly, I'm eager to teach when necessary and learn whenever I am afforded the opportunity.

## What doing my best work means

I've worked for small, medium, and large organizations. Truthfully, I want my work to matter and make a difference to the organization. I have confidence in my UI abilities, and I know I can write scalable and maintainable code. Doing my best work means I'm proud of the product I am building. It means laying it out there and being able to live with the result. **Doing my best work means, being the tide that lifts all boats.**

    - 5+ Years Engineering on UI from Legacy applications to Next.JS built upon React hosted in AWS Amplify.

    - A fine balance is key. You pick: Cheap, quick, or quality, but you can only pick 2!

## What would set you apart

- [x] **If you're known for excellent communication skills.**
    - How am I doing?
- [x] **If you could teach a class on TypeScript, React, Slate, Mantine or other tools of the modern web.**
    - I gave a talk on benefits of Typescript at CareCloud to UI Guild (does this count?)

    - Finally stumped me, I have limited experience with AWS and Google Cloud services. Give me a chance to learn more. My experience is in AWS Amplify where he hosted a UI app.
- [x] **You understand the startup journey and have seen the path to product-market-fit.**
    - This journey isn't for the feint of heart. "We don't have time to keep reviewing all these applications, this guy Nick is what we're looking for." - Sean ::very very soon::

## Applying via PR ... please review :)

In all seriousness Sean, if you are still reading I would love to learn more about what you're trying to build. I am not toting myself as the absolute best, far from it. There are gaps, but I do believe I can contribute in a meaningful way. Hopefully, I've shown my creativity and willingness to go above and beyond. 

P.S. I'm going to spam your inbox with my resume as well.
